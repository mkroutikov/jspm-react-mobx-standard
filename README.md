# Boilerplate for ReactJS

Uses:
* `jspm` for package and dependency management
* `babel` for transpiling
* `mobx` for state management
* `react` as a UI framework
* `standard` as a linter
* `mocha` for testing

In addition to providing a final boilerplate project, this repository explains why we need this or that
configuration option and dependency. Hopefully this will allow someone to better understand the process
and fix it as tools evolve.

To see the configuration steps, do this:
```
git branch
```
This will show the list of available branches. Each branch is built on top of the previous and adds another feature and explanation in the `README.md`.

To research the process simply use GitHub [branch comparison tool](https://github.com/mkroutikov/jspm-react-mobx-standard/compare/step7...step8?expand=1).

To use as a pre-built boilerplate:
```
git clone https://github.com/mkroutikov/jspm-react-mobx-standard.git
git checkout step8
```
